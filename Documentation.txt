1. Getting all data from the database.

Solution:
	-Check all the function between the commands and services check also
	the routing request in controllers 70% of the problem maybe in the
	functions of the request which is in the commands and services.


project structure : 
	Models -> lahat ng data na papasok sa database ay nakabase sa loob ng
		  models.
	Controllers -> Dito nangyayari ang routing request ng API like post,
		       delete, get, post
	Commands -> Nangyayari dito ang methods na  post, put and delete method
		    na gagamitin ng controllers
	Services -> dito nangyayari ang get function na gagamitin din ng controllers
		    upang magamit para mafetch lahat ng data sa Api
